        E.g. 8 hours per day for a max of 260 days.

        You may want to take time off for training and conferences.

    <p>
        0 indicates no additional cost. Default: 30% means 30% additional costs. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are looking for how much you can earn in relation to your current salary,
        then enter your estimated additional cost to the employer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The employee's salary is not the employers only cost per employee.
        The company also have to pay for your benefits,
        insurance, tax, office space, utilities,
        admin staff, training, hardware, licenses, liabilities, etc.
        This can be as low as additional 30% cost per employee,
        however in some countries and companies this can be 2x or 3x the salary.
    </p>
    <p>
        However if you are looking for what you need to charge for equivalent salary,
        then you need to enter your estimated additional costs as a contractor instead.
    </p>
    <p>
       As a self employed contractor you have to pay for your
        pension, insurance, accountants, PCs, mobiles, tools, training, conferences, commuting cost,
        non-invoiceable time for admin &amp; sales, etc.
        If you want to cut things to the bone, pick a percentage closer to 0.

    <legend>Utilisation</legend>
    <input type="text" name="contractingRate.utilisation" value="${flash['contractingRate.utilisation']?:90}" maxlength="3" size="4" />

    <p>
        100% indicates full utilisation. Default: 90% utilisation.
    </p>
    <p>
        How long a gap will you have between contracts.
        It is difficult to finish one contract on a Friday
        and always having another starting the following Monday.
        Some bench time must be expected, 2 weeks here, a week there or worse.

    <legend>Tax difference</legend>
    <input type="text" name="contractingRate.tax" value="${flash['contractingRate.tax']?:10}" maxlength="3" size="4" />
    <label>%</label>
    <p>
        0 means no difference, -20 means 20% less tax. Default: 10% means 10% more tax. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As a contractor with your own limited company 
        you might pay less tax personally
        compared to a permanent employee.
        However in the UK, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR35">IR35</a> means some <i>umbrella</i> contractors
        pay a little more than before.
