    <input type="text" name="contractingRate.salary" value="${flash['contractingRate.salary']?:50000}" maxlength="12" size="8"/>
    <label>(currency irrelevant)</label>
    <p>How much would your earn as an employee per year before tax.</p>
</fieldset>

    <legend>Hours per year</legend>
    <input type="text" name="contractingRate.hoursYear" value="${flash['contractingRate.hoursYear']?:1600}" maxlength="5" size="4" />

    <p>
        <a href="@{Application.hoursPerYear}">How many hours will you be available to work per year</a>(invoice).   <br/>
        E.g. 8 hours per day for a max of 260 days.
        You may want holidays or you may be sick.
        You may want to take time off for training and conferences.

<fieldset>
    <legend>Hours per day</legend>
    <input type="text" name="contractingRate.hoursDay" value="${flash['contractingRate.hoursDay']?:7.5}" maxlength="3" size="4" />
    <label>hours</label>
    <p>Not including lunch. I use 7.5 per day.</p>

<fieldset>
    <legend>Additional cost</legend>
    <input type="text" name="contractingRate.cost" value="${flash['contractingRate.cost']?:50}" maxlength="3" size="4" />
    <label>%</label>
    <p>
        0 indicates no additional cost. 10 means 10% additional costs. Default: 50%.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are looking for how much you can earn in relation to your current salary,
        then enter your estimated additional cost to the employer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The employee's salary is not the employers only cost per employee.
        The company also have to pay for your benefits,
        insurance, tax, office space, utilities,
        admin staff, training, hardware, licenses, liabilities, etc.
        This can be as low as additional 30% cost per employee,
        however in some countries and companies this can be 2x or 3x the salary.
    </p>
    <p>
        However if you are looking for what you need to charge for equivalent salary,
        then you need to enter your estimated additional costs as a contractor instead.
    </p>
    <p>
       As a self employed contractor you have to pay for your
        pension, insurance, accountants, PCs, mobiles, tools, training, conferences, commuting cost,
        non-invoiceable time for admin &amp; sales, etc.
        If you want to cut things to the bone, pick a percentage closer to 0.
    </p>

    <legend>Utilisation</legend>
    <input type="text" name="contractingRate.utilisation" value="${flash['contractingRate.utilisation']?:90}" maxlength="3" size="4" />
    <label>%</label>
    <p>
        100 indicates full utilisation. Default: 90% utilisation.<br/>
        How long a gap will you have between contracts.
        It is difficult to finish one contract on the Friday
        and always having another starting the following Monday.
        Some bench time must be expected, 2 weeks here, a week there or worse.
    </p>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
    <legend>Tax difference</legend>
    <input type="text" name="contractingRate.tax" value="${flash['contractingRate.tax']?:10}" maxlength="3" size="4" />
    <label>%</label>
    <p>
        0 means no difference, 10 means 10% more tax. -20 means 20% less tax. Default: 10%. <br/>
       As a contractor you might pay less tax personally
        compared to as a permanent employee.
        However in the UK, IR35 means <i>umbrella</i>  contractors
        pay a little more than before.
